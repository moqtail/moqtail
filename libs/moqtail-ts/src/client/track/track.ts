 * Describes a media/data track known to the client (either published locally or subscribed to).

 * const liveStream: ReadableStream<MoqtObject> = buildCameraStream()
 * const track: Track = {
 *   fullTrackName,
 *   forwardingPreference: ObjectForwardingPreference.Latest,
 *   trackSource: { live: liveStream },

 * @example Past only track (preâ€‘recorded cache)
 * ```ts
 * const cache = new MemoryObjectCache()
 * recording.forEach(obj => cache.add(obj))
 * const track: Track = {
