### Minor Changes

- [#23](https://github.com/streaming-university/moqtail/pull/23) [`b3c1d3d`](https://github.com/streaming-university/moqtail/commit/b3c1d3de5728eb33a51aca8883cc26467eb59639) Thanks [@kerembkmz](https://github.com/kerembkmz)! - Feature Added: Emoji Support in Chat Interface

  Issue:
  Previously, users could not send or view emojis in the MOQtail chat, resulting in a limited chat experience.

  Fix Summary:
  - Integrated an emoji picker UI with categorized emoji sets.
  - Enabled emoji insertion via quick reactions and full picker interface.
  - Implemented logic to detect and render emoji-only and mixed text messages.
  - Improved chat display for better readability and visual appeal of emojis.
